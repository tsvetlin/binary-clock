# ESP8266 Binary Clock

This project creates a binary clock, which is shown on a tiny OLED LCD. The ESP connects to an NTP server via Wi-Fi to get the current time.

What do you need to create this project?

1.) ESP8266 (ESP-12E)
2.) 128*64 I2C OLED LCD
3.) 4 jumper wires
4.) 1 breadboard
5.) 1 Micro USB cable

### Wiring
128x64 OLED pinout:
GND goes to GND
VIN goes to 3.3V
SDA to I2C SDA (D2, GPIO 4)
SCL to I2C SCL (D1, GPIO 5)


### Result
